and inform you either by email or by phone of the dispatch of your ordered product. Before your order is
confirmed, you may be asked to provide additional verifications or information, including but not limited to phone

contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the products.

accounts for products intended to be purchased on the Site.
Our voucher codes may not be exchanged for cash. With the exception of vouchers issued in accordance with our
refunds policy and vouchers issued in exchange for advance payments, we reserve the right to cancel or withdraw
our voucher codes at any time.
